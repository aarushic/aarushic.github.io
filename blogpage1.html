What you get access to: For these boxes we would make it so that they display a title and when someone hovers over them, they display different text and that new text will be the description of that type of analytic 
Box 1: Number and Type of Appointments Made
If you opted for the scheduling feature, we can show you the number and type of appointments your patients made using that feature. 
Box 2: Number of Patients Signed Up for the Automatic Messaging Feature
If you opted for the automatic messaging feature, we can show you how many of your patients signed up for it.
Box 3: Number of People who Used the Chat
If you opted for the direct chat line feature, we give you access to see how many of your patients used it. 
Box 4: Number and Type of Virtual Appointments Held
If you opted for the video services feature, we can tell you how many virtual appointments your practice held in a period of time and even break that down based on the type of appointments.
Box 5: Number of Patients who Updated their Medical Records
If you opted for the medical record database feature, we can tell you how many patients updated their records.
Box 6: And more
The analytics listed above are only some of the ones that you will get access to when you sign up for this feature. Other analytics are available depending on the features you purchase from us. 



this section and the one below it will be in side by side boxes; this is a deviation from them original layout but I think this will work better
Also, there will be a picture in the background of this text but it’s going to be semi transparent https://www.pexels.com/photo/top-view-of-people-at-the-meeting-3184287/ 

Title: What else?
Text 2: 
The different analytics will be updated daily and you will have the option to see them for each day/week/month/year. You can also choose to view the analytics in a chart or graph format. That's the beauty of this feature; we give the option to view this data in whatever manner you see fit! It’s also important to note here that the analytics you get access to depend on the other features that you choose to purchase from us. In other words, you will only get the analytics for the features you buy. 

Title: Why is this beneficial?
Text3:
By using these analytics, you get an in-depth view of both your patients and your own practice. You can then use this data to assess your own online progress and success and tailor your methods to better help your patients. At Connect Health, we believe in helping our clients get whatever they need to help their patients in the digital landscape, and this feature does exactly that.

The part below this isn’t actually going to be on the website; it’s just my planning, 

What this feature does:
Let’s you assess your own online progress and success by giving you access to the analytics related the solutions you bought
Note that you only get access to the analytics that are relevant to the solutions that you purchased for us (so if you didn’t get the direct chat line feature, you will not get the analytics for that feature)
The analytics you will get access to: 
The number and type of appointments made using the scheduling feature
How many patients signed up for the automatic messaging feature
How many people used the direct chat line 
How many virtual appointments were held using the video services feature (broken down based on the type of appointments, the doctor/nurse, etc.)
How many patients updated their record in the medical database
etc.

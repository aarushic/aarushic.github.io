Variants Vs. Vaccines <p>
       
       </p>

As more variants pop up the main question is whether the vaccines will work on them. Mainly because most mutations are known to affect the spike of the virus, which is something that reduces the effectiveness of the vaccines. As the spike of a virus is what is targeted by a vaccine.

 Due to this Biotech companies are testing their vaccines against the new variants. What is good is that companies like Moderna and Pfizer have mRNA technology that allows for the quick reprogramming to target new variants. But as these tests are being run, while the vaccines still have some effect, they appeared to be less effective.

Considering this, scientists anticipate a solution akin to the flu, where we would need an annual covid shot, where companies will constantly be matching their vaccines to the predominant strand and have booster shots to stay safe.

       </p>How do we protect ourselves from these variants?
<p>
<p>
  
       </p>The same measure we have been practicing till now- social distancing, wearing masks, and hygiene- should be amped up. They are even more critical as the variants continue to become more transmissible. It also helps stop the virus from mutating as it will be harder for them to replicate.

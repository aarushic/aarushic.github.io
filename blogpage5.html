       <p>Life has changed since the COVID-19 outbreak but you should still follow safe practices when celebrating this holiday season.
</p>
  
       <p>
A lot of things have changed this year, and one thing that will be affected is the holidays. We know you miss going out to meet people and want to celebrate with your families in person, but this year's circumstances mean that isn't the safest thing to do.
</p>
  
       <p>

Especially if you have at risk family members or live far away, meeting in person may not be a wise option for your family. Regardless, you should discuss with the rest of your family about what sacrifices will need to be made and what everyone is comfortable with before making your plans.

</p>
  
       <p>If you  must travel for the holidays make sure to follow social distancing guidelines and bring lots of masks. Especially try to avoid travel by plane or other crowded modes of transportation.  Make sure everyone involved understands the risks. </p>
  
       <p>The safest option for the holidays this year would be a virtual gathering through a video platform like Zoom, FaceTime, or Skype. You can still send and exchange gifts through postal services and arrange a virtual meeting to play games and share stories through the screen.
</p>

       
       
       <p style="font-size:20px">
        <b> Here are some new ideas.</b></p>
       
       <p>
While the new advancements with vaccines have given us a chance to look forward to a better future, very soon, taking precautions while socializing, until everything is finalized is probably the best decision to make.<p>
       
       </p>
<p>
One of the main things we need to learn to adjust is the fun of gathering in groups until all vaccinations and health precautions have been set for everyone around us.  Instead,  schedule more frequent, one-on-one outings with friends in safe settings.  
Even though you might be vaccinated, it does not guarantee as much as you probably think it might, so expanding your social bubble should probably wait for a bit.
</p>
  
       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>Explore the Outside. </b></p>

  
       <p>While this has probably been saying a million times, it is great advice. Go on walks or runs with friends, while adhering to all of the usual coronavirus prevention measures. At this time, 
you will have the opportunity to explore new places. ( And with covid laws lifting, movie theaters, shopping, etc,  also seems like a great way to spend your time, but do make sure to follow previously stated guidelines).
</p>
  
      
<p> As mentioned above, take advantage of your video calling abilities. Much like the service we provide, use facetime, zoom, or another tech too, make shorter calls with one or two. You can show off your latest home-improvement project, cooking achievement, or holiday decorations.
More things include taking advantage of some old-fashioned communication. Writing letters, emailing, skype, can all be fun ways to alternate communication between you and everyone.  You can even invest in converting some activities into online ones. Book clubs, the one yoga class you wanted to join online, or even some online art classes.
</p>
  
   
  
       <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Overall, things are clearing up. Soon enough maybe we will be able to host our yearly thanksgiving parties and celebrate with actual people. But until then make good decisions, stay safe and enjoy! </b>
